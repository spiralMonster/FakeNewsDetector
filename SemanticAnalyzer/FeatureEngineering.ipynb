       "'In case everyone didn t know, Trump can throw a perfect spiral through a tire, swishes foul shot after foul shot, and, additionally, is clearly sleeping with Anthony Scaramucci.Donald Trump s newest hire wasted no time before immediately swooning over his new boss.On Friday, White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer resigned after Scaramucci was picked as the White House Communications Director.Scaramuccia took to the podium and spoke to the White House Press Corps for about an hour, during which, he professed his deep love of Donald Trump and acted as a glorified hype-man desperate to portray Trump as heroic, intelligent, and physically impressive. I think he s got some of the best political instincts in the world, and perhaps in history,  Scaramucci said, immediately commencing with the ass-kissing.When asked if Trump will get his terrible healthcare bill passed, Scaramucci practically gushed over him. The president has really good karma, OK?  he said.  And the world turns back to him. He s genuinely a wonderful human being and I think as members of Congress get to know him better and get comfortable with him, they re going to let him lead them to the right things for the American people. Scaramucci didn t stop there. He went full groupie by openly admiring Trump s  competitiveness  and was in full awe of Trump s alleged athletic feats. I ve seen this guy throw a dead spiral through a tire. I ve seen him at Madison Square Garden with a topcoat on. He s standing in the key; he s hitting foul shots and swishing them, all right? He sinks 30-foot putts. Here s the video via Twitter.there s been a lot of lies from the White House but  trump is a phenomenal athlete  might take the cake pic.twitter.com/ru5YIfZvCi  jordan ?? (@JordanUhl) July 21, 2017Now, Scaramuccia may have actually seen Trump do these things, and there is some footage of Trump throwing a football through a hole. But as the Washington Post pointed out, nothing Scaramucci bragged about proves that Trump is  competitive  because nothing he did was in the heat of competition.But the fact that Scaramucci went out of his way to suck up to Trump in this fashion absolutely proves that he is nothing more than an ass-kisser on a level that must be making Sean Hannity insanely jealous.With that being said, here s Trump and Scaramucci s song. Clearly, it should have been the background music playing during the press briefing.Featured Image: Screenshot'"

       "'(Reuters) - A U.S. congressional proposal that would eliminate income tax exemptions for certain airlines could affect major Gulf carriers, potentially worsening an international spat between U.S. airlines and their Middle East rivals. U.S. airlines have been petitioning the federal government for years to intervene in what they see as unfair competition by the three major Gulf carriers.    The proposal, tucked deep in the Senate tax-cut plan, calls for airlines headquartered in foreign countries to pay the U.S. incorporate tax rate if: 1) the carrier’s home country does not have an income tax treaty with the United States and 2) the carrier’s country of origin has fewer than two arrivals and departures, per week, operated by major U.S. airlines.  Airways, Emirates [EMIRA.UL] and Etihad Airways have for years been accused by U.S. competitors of being illegally subsidized by their governments. The Gulf carriers deny the accusation. They could not immediately be reached for comment on Thursday. If the proposal passes, it could leave the Gulf carriers more vulnerable because their home countries – the United Arab Emirates and Qatar – do not have income tax treaties with the United States, according to the Internal Revenue Service website. A number of nations could possibly also be affected at a time when perceived discrepancies in U.S. trade agreements are facing a critical eye from U.S. corporations and the federal government.       The language in the Senate proposal sets the stage for a crackdown in tax leniency for these and other airlines. This would likely be well-received by American carriers, which have for years petitioned the U.S. government to intervene in the dispute. Under U.S. tax treaties, entities of foreign countries are either exempt or pay a reduced rate on their income, and vice versa for U.S. entities abroad. Reciprocity agreements, however, are less formal deals that fall short of an official accord, according to tax attorney Sam Brotman of Brotman Law. “Reciprocity agreements are usually with countries that are not necessarily 100 percent friendly with the U.S.” Brotman said on Thursday. “We’ll call it a handshake deal.” The bill’s wording stands to ramp up an already tense battle between U.S. airlines and Gulf carriers.  The addition was introduced by U.S. Senator Johnny Isakson of Georgia. Delta Air Lines (DAL.N), one of the most vocal critics of Gulf carrier practices, is headquartered in Atlanta.  A spokeswoman for Isakson did not mention the Gulf airlines.    “This provision supports American jobs by providing a level playing field and mutual fairness in international passenger aviation,” Isakson spokeswoman Marie Gordon said in an email on Thursday.  “Foreign airlines should not receive preferential tax treatment if their countries choose not to open their markets to U.S. companies.” Delta declined to comment.

So, Bannon headed back to fake news site Breitbart.com.  Sniff, I m gonna take my ball and go home! Bannon will be greeted by advertisers fleeing from the site. In recent months, nearly 2,600 advertisers have discontinued their ads from the site which is presently publishing smear pieces against Trump s National Security Adviser, H.R. McMaster.A boycott by a grassroots campaign was launched against the site and that seems to have been effective considering the mass exodus of advertisers.The campaign works like this: tweets are directed to advertisers, like this one which reads,  @SimpleTire are you aware that your ads are running on Breitbart s hateful site? @slpng_giants can help! Just ask.  Hi Mistie, Thanks for letting us know, we have removed them from our ad feed. @slpng_giants  SimpleTire.com (@SimpleTire) August 21, 2017Boom! Simple Tire has removed their ads from Breitbart.The Independent reports:According to a tweet by Sleeping Giants, a campaign group aiming to pressure companies into cutting ties with media they deem to be racist or sexist, the number of advertisers that have ceased advertising is  climbing towards 2,600 .The individual behind Sleeping Giants has been at this for quite awhile.Here are a few examples:CONFIRMED: @medpost has blocked Breitbart from their media buy!

Bannon is reportedly  ramping up for war  against Trump now that he s been fired.Bannon friend says Breitbart ramping up for war against Trump. \"It\\'s now a Democrat White House,\" source says.  Gabriel Sherman (@gabrielsherman) August 18, 2017Breitbart editor Joel Pollak suggested that Bannon s ousting means  war. #WAR  Joel B. Pollak (@joelpollak) August 18, 2017Well, we know what kind of war Trump can expect from the Alt-Right site. Twitter accounts with Pepe the Frog avatars will be launched, and perhaps they ll start conspiracy theories about Trump, maybe saying that he has low stamina, he s sick and doesn t have long to live (because he coughed), and who knows, Trump might visit a pizzeria where there is obviously a child sex slave ring in the basement   even though it doesn t have a basement.Breitbart has even more to worry about. In May it was reported that Breitbart.com has fallen from 45th place to 281st place in news site traffic ratings since March, according to the web analytics company Alexa.com. As of August 19th, Breitbart has fallen to 298th place in traffic ratings.I know how Breitbart can get their traffic booming again. If Bannon has access to the pee-pee tapes and publishes them, he can give his site s servers a real test for how much traffic it can hold.

       "'WASHINGTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. House of Representatives’ energy committee on Wednesday said it wants the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to explain how it is overseeing contracts for rebuilding Puerto Rico’s power grid after it was devastated by Hurricane Maria. In a letter to FEMA, the committee raised questions about contracts between Puerto Rico’s Electric Power Authority (PREPA) and two companies: Whitefish Energy Holdings and Cobra Acquisitions LLC, a subsidiary of Mammoth Energy Services Inc. Six weeks after the hurricane swept across the island, two-thirds of its residents are still without electricity. Washington is preparing to spend billions on relief for the territory, home to 3.4 million Americans, with assistance for the grid seen as one of the most expensive and complex pieces of the aid. The House Energy and Commerce committee - one of several panels of lawmakers keeping a close eye on Puerto Rico projects - said in its letter that “federal leadership and strategic coordination” are needed to restore power, and outlined a series of concerns about the role played so far by FEMA. Usually, power utilities seek help from other utility companies to restore power immediately after disasters. But Puerto Rico first turned to contractors, as utilities were leery about getting paid by PREPA, which declared bankruptcy in July. On Sunday, Puerto Rican Governor Ricardo Rossello and PREPA said they would cancel a $300 million contract with Whitefish Energy Holdings, after a controversy over the deal’s provisions and the Montana company’s lack of experience with projects of such a large size. The committee said it was concerned about FEMA’s oversight of the Whitefish contract. “We have a contract with PREPA, and how PREPA and FEMA are interacting, that is PREPA’s issue,” a spokesman for Whitefish said in a statement. Lawmakers also questioned provisions in a PREPA contract issued to Cobra Acquisitions, including “language which would appear to have the effect of preventing government oversight of the agreement.” In a statement, Cobra said its managers met with PREPA at its command center and “described the company’s experience, ability to mobilize quickly and its plan to aid in the restoration of power to the island. We also met with representatives of FEMA, the Army Corps of Engineers and other key agencies.” FEMA asked the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers on Sept. 30 to take on an extra role in emergency repairs of the grid because of the scope of the damage. The Army Corps has awarded some of its own contracts and is boosting its presence. The lawmakers asked FEMA to brief its staff by Nov. 15. The agency did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Wednesday. FEMA Administrator Brock Long testified to a Senate committee on Tuesday that the agency was not notified until “several weeks after the fact” that PREPA had contracted with Whitefish, and had not agreed to the contract language. “Not one dollar has gone toward that contract from FEMA,” Long said, telling senators that the agency is making sure PREPA has not asked for reimbursement for the work. Long told senators that FEMA’s coordinator on the island has asked PREPA to “make sure that we are unified with the Army Corps so we’re not working in separate streams, but we’re working together in a consolidated effort.” '"

Both good Democrats and good Republicans who put country over party did it before with Watergate.

       "'(Reuters) - President Donald Trump’s administration called two lawmakers from the U.S. corn belt to convince them to join talks about potential changes to biofuels policy to ease the burden on oil refineries, according to a spokesman for one of the lawmakers and a source briefed on the matter. The effort is the clearest sign yet Trump is seeking to mediate the long-running dispute between the U.S. oil industry and corn growers over the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS), a law requiring refiners to blend increasing volumes of biofuels like corn-based ethanol every year into the nation’s fuels. Refiners say the law is putting them out of business, but ethanol interests have vehemently opposed any changes.  White House Chief of Staff General John Kelly on Thursday called Republican Senator Chuck Grassley of corn-growing state Iowa - a leading supporter of the biofuels industry - to discuss the possibility of a meeting, Grassley’s office told Reuters on Friday.  And Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue called Republican Senator Joni Ernst, also of Iowa, on the issue, a source briefed on the matter told Reuters, asking not to be named. Trump and senior cabinet officials met with nine Republican senators from states with oil refineries on Thursday, including Ted Cruz of Texas. Some of the senators said after the meeting that Trump was interested in having all sides on the issue work together toward a solution. A spokesman for Grassley’s office said that Grassley “would of course meet with any senator who requests a meeting.” The spokesman, Michael Zona, added that Kelly, in his call to Grassley, “reiterated the president’s unwavering commitment to ethanol, the RFS and Midwestern farmers.”  Officials in Ernst’s office and at the White House did not respond to a request for comment. A new meeting could be scheduled as early as next week, according to the source briefed on the matter. The talks could lay the groundwork for potential future legislation to overhaul the RFS program, but would require co-operation from representatives of the corn industry to pass Congress.      The RFS was introduced more than a decade ago by President George W. Bush as a way to boost U.S. agriculture, slash energy imports and cut emissions, and has since fostered a market for ethanol amounting to 15 billion gallons a year. Refiners oppose the RFS because they say it costs them hundreds of millions of dollars a year in blending and regulatory expenses, while propping up demand for rival fuels.  The industry has requested tweaks to the policy in the past that would cut the annual volume targets for biofuels, allow ethanol exports to be counted against those targets, or shift the blending burden to supply terminals from refiners.      But the Trump administration has ruled in favor of Big Corn and against the refining industry in a series of decisions this year.  Last month, the Environmental Protection Agency, the regulator which administers the RFS, slightly increased biofuels volumes targets for 2018. Senators on both sides of the debate have used parliamentary procedures like holds on administrative appointments to punish rivals. For example, Cruz has said he would block Iowa Agriculture Secretary Bill Northey’s nomination to a key post at the U.S. Department of Agriculture until he gets a meeting about a biofuels compromise that includes all sides.

       "'People like to pretend that Mike Pence is the grown-up in the room compared to Donald Trump s brash childishness from the White House. However, he proved that wrong on Sunday, when he left the Indiana Colts football game because a few of the players on the team opposing the Colts chose to take a knee during the national anthem to protest police brutality against black and brown Americans. Taking a leaf out of Trump s playbook, Pence tweeted:I left today\\'s Colts game because @POTUS and I will not dignify any event that disrespects our soldiers, our Flag, or our National Anthem.  Vice President Pence (@VP) October 8, 2017While everyone is entitled to their own opinions, I don\\'t think it\\'s too much to ask NFL players to respect the Flag and our National Anthem  Vice President Pence (@VP) October 8, 2017Just like Trump, Pence forgets the meaning of the First Amendment, and seems to think that his position gives him the right to try to bully owners, players, and ultimately the National Football League into following his orders. Further, it is worth noting that the Colts were playing the San Francisco 49ers, which is the former team of Colin Kaepernick, the man who started this protest before being blacklisted from the NFL for taking a stand against police brutality against people of color. Further, Pence and Trump admitted that they used the situation to divide the country and make some kind of point on the taxpayers  dime   because of course we paid for Pence to travel to that football game. For one thing, the press was kept in the van, in anticipation of Pence stirring the pot and then leaving:The media pool was kept in the vans ahead of the game instead of being led in with VPOTUS. https://t.co/NXIFZCp3fb  Vaughn Hillyard (@VaughnHillyard) October 8, 2017FLAG: Was Pence leaving Colts game a political stunt? Reporters were told to stay in van bc \"there may be an early departure from the game.\"  Peter Alexander (@PeterAlexander) October 8, 2017Then, Trump  admitted to ordering Pence to leave if the 49ers took a knee, which of course everyone knew they would:I asked @VP Pence to leave stadium if any players kneeled, disrespecting our country. I am proud of him and @SecondLady Karen.  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 8, 2017So, in short, this was all premeditated racial pot stirring. Unsurprising from Trump, but somewhat surprising from Pence, who has been trying very hard to keep up the idea of how OMFG #notracist! he is. Well, that s out the window now.Another white supremacist takes his hood off in the Trump Administration.Featured image via Justin Sullivan/Getty Images'"

       "'Ever since Donald Trump failed his test of moral leadership following the Nazi/white Supremacist rally in Charlottesville, VA, his administration has been bleeding.First, his business council collapsed when business leader after business leader said they wanted no part in Trump s sympathy with Nazis. The same is now happening with his Committee on the Arts and Humanities as 16 members of the group sent Trump a resignation letter that was just perfect   if you re a member of the resistance.Here is a part of the resignation letter: Reproach and censure in the strongest possible terms are necessary following your support of the hate groups and terrorists who killed and injured fellow Americans in Charlottesville. The false equivalencies you push cannot stand. The Administrations refusal to quickly and unequivocally condemn the cancer of hatred only further emboldens those who wish America ill. We cannot sit idly by, the way your West Wing advisors have, without speaking out against your words and actions. We are members of the Presidents Committee on the Arts and Humanities (PCAH). The Committee was created in 1982 under President Reagan to advise the White House on cultural issues. We were hopeful that continuing to serve in the PCAH would allow us to focus on the important work the committee does with your federal partners in the arts and humanities for all Americans. Effective immediately, please accept our resignation Source: ViceHere s the full letter, signed by 16 members, including artist Chuck Close, author Jhumpa Lahiri, architect Thom Mayne and  Jersey Boys  actor John Lloyd Young and Minnesota Congressman Richard Cohen:JUST IN: In letter to Pres.

Its core areas of focus are arts and humanities education and cultural exchange.It s also traditionally headed by the First Lady and this administration is no exception.Featured image via Matt Cardy/Getty Images'"

       "\"Jesus f*cking Christ our President* is a moron. Not satisfied with simply wasting billions of taxpayer dollars on a border wall, The Donald wants it to be see-through too   not to preserve the view of scenery but because he s afraid people might be killed by gigantic sacks of drugs that are totally going to be thrown over it on a regular basis (thus negating his argument that the wall will somehow curb drug trafficking). As horrible as it sounds, when they throw the large sacks of drugs over, and if you have people on the other side of the wall, you don t see them they hit you on the head with 60 pounds of the stuff? It s over,  the President said aboard Air Force One Wednesday according to the official White House transcript.  As cray as that sounds, you need transparency through that wall. Trump says border wall with Mexico should be transparent so that people aren't killed when drug couriers throw 60-lbs. bags over it. pic.twitter.com/0GXJuHjPxs  Gregory Korte (@gregorykorte) July 13, 2017It s unclear if Trump actually said  cray  or if the White House stenographer made a typo, but the idea that we will be so beleaguered by so many flying 60-pound sacks of drugs that the border wall needs to be  transparent  is pretty  cray. Now, Trump could have argued that there are a number of reasons for  transparency    to see those dirty brownish people he hates coming, for instance. But he chose the dumb one that involves throwing a 60-pound bag of heroin over a 20-foot fence.Naturally, Americans find this hilarious:The bad hombres are very strong.  Juha (@juhasaarinen) July 14, 2017I imagined just this with  Acme  printed on the side.

Tinz (@TinzRules) July 13, 2017Likelihood that Trump heard someone say  We need transparency on the building of the Wall  and didn t understand?  Patrick (@PatrickCragg) July 13, 2017Crushed by Giant Bag of Dope is pretty high on most people s Preferred Ways To Die list, I ve heard.  Just Dessert (@Love_CrimeDrama) July 13, 2017Crushed by Giant Bag of Dope was, in my opinion, Giant Bag of Dope s best album.  David J Britton (@Tyburn_Cross) July 13, 2017I want to meet the dealer that can toss a 60 lb bag over the wall or, do they use catapults?  nicefellow31 (@nicefellow31) July 13, 2017They prefer trebuchets, I m told.  Carly (@whatstudentloan) July 13, 2017The beauty of this, though, is if the bag misses your head  Hey! Free heroin!  Christopher Keelty (@keeltyc) July 13, 2017 Some areas that are so far away from the border? Some parts of the border are far away from the border? #wtf #cray  Matthew R. Kerns (@mattkerns) July 13, 2017So, these drug smugglers, they can toss 60 pound bags of coke over 20 foot walls, but can t climb a mountain?  High Quality Nephew (@JohnNephew) July 13, 2017 This piece of fence would be supes far away. You d have to be totes cray to cross there. So you fo sho don t need that.    def on fleek  Henkepotamus (@Henke2020) July 13, 2017You laugh but this is a serious problem. pic.twitter.com/1jGkVDGmt6  Erase Rewind (@EraseRewind1) July 13, 2017If there are people throwing 60 lbs sacks of stuff over high walls we should get them on our team.  Rich (@Argonzo) July 13, 2017So: you happen to stand next to a giant 900 mi. wall when BAM! You re hit with a 60 lb. bag of drugs tossed over this huge wall to no one??  Spooky Comet (@spookycomet) July 13, 2017one thing is right, this shit is cray  Ella s Girl (@ellasgirl7) July 13, 2017This can t possibly be real because . . . never mind. I m sorry, I forgot who we were referring to.   Kit Yona (@TheKitastrophe) July 13, 2017Wow. Vicious rivers and  cray  60-lb falling bags of heroin. Why would people stand next to the wall? Will there be a Starbucks?  Tom Brouns (@TAZMPictures) July 14, 2017Ask him to point out the  violent and vicious  rivers on a map. WTF is he talking about?  John Daws (@grajillas) July 13, 2017Who the F*ck is throwing 60lb sacks of drugs over the wall? Cause pretty sure they make some $$$ in pro sports!  R Goldman (@sttrzangel) July 14, 2017Where would Trump get the idea to tell Americans that criminals across the border are killing people with giant sacks of drugs? North Korean propaganda of course   or what seems like North Korean propaganda until you realize it s a parody account:Six innocent children killed by south Korean criminals hurling huge sacks of illegal drugs over inter-Korean demilitarized zone wall. pic.twitter.com/bfnNlBIs4e  DPRK News Service (@DPRK_News) July 13, 2017If you re thinking this is disgraceful even for Trump, you probably should be aware that we have not yet seen the depths to which he is willing to sink in his quest for power.We need to face the fact that our  President  is completely  cray  and let the GOP know they need to do their jobs and remove him from office now.featured image via Getty Images/screengrab\""

       "'Trump supporters and the so-called president s favorite network are lashing out at special counsel Robert Mueller and the FBI. The White House is in panic-mode after Mueller obtained tens of thousands of transition team emails as part of the Russian probe. Ironically, it will quite possibly be emails that brings Trump down.A lawyer for the Trump transition team is claiming that the emails had been illegally turned over by the General Services Administration because the account owners never received notification of the request and he s claiming that they were  privileged communications. In a letter, Trump s attorney requested that Congress  act immediately to protect future presidential transitions from having their private records misappropriated by government agencies, particularly in the context of sensitive investigations intersecting with political motives. Mueller spokesman Peter Carr defended the special counsel s work in a statement issued just past midnight on Sunday, several hours after claims of   unlawful conduct  by Trump s attorney were made, according to Politico. When we have obtained emails in the course of our ongoing criminal investigation, we have secured either the account owner s consent or appropriate criminal process,  he said.The words that pop out in the statement are  criminal investigation,  the  account owner s consent  and  criminal process. While on the campaign trail, Donald Trump asked Russians to hack Hillary Clinton s emails. After the election, Trump s team is claiming that Mueller obtained the transition teams  emails illegally, even though that s not the truth. We see a pattern here.Team Trump thought Mueller was on a fishing expedition. Turns out, he was actually reeling in the fish. The White House was not aware at the time that he had the emails. Mueller got them through GSA so that team Trump could not selectively leave any out if they were requested.Merry Christmas, Mr. Trump.Photo by Ann Heisenfelt/Getty Images.'"

       "'WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump will further pressure Chinese President Xi Jinping in talks next week to take tougher measures against North Korea, as the United States compiles information for possible new sanctions on Chinese banks working with Pyongyang. Senior administration officials say Trump will try to convince Xi when they meet in Beijing to squeeze North Korea with steps such as limits on oil exports, coal imports and financial transactions. It is the latest attempt by Trump to have China, North Korea’s only major ally, rein in Pyongyang’s nuclear weapons ambitions but it is far from clear if Xi, who has just consolidated his power at a Communist Party congress, will agree. China says its leverage over Pyongyang is exaggerated, and points to its support in the U.N. Security Council for recent sanctions on North Korea as evidence that it is trying to curtail the isolated nation’s nuclear and missile tests.     North Korea this year conducted a powerful nuclear test detonation and has test-fired intercontinental ballistic missiles that, if perfected, could reach the U.S. mainland. Trump has vowed to prevent North Korea gaining that capability. Two U.S. officials said the threat of additional U.N. and other economic sanctions on North Korea is another option to solicit greater cooperation from China, by playing on Beijing’s concerns that deeper poverty in North Korea could prompt an exodus of refugees across its border. The officials said the United States and its allies have been collecting detailed information on Chinese bank transactions with North Korea to try to identify institutions with the “most egregious” records of doing business with Pyongyang. The objective, the officials said, is to craft a proposal for escalating sanctions on Chinese financial and other entities that stops short of sanctioning the People’s Bank of China central bank. Washington so far has mostly held off on new sanctions against Chinese banks and companies doing business with North Korea, given fears of retaliation by Beijing and possibly far-reaching effects on the world economy. In a brief statement on Thursday formally announcing the visit from the Chinese end, the country’s foreign ministry said China was ready to work with the United States to achieve “important results” for Trump’s visit. It did not elaborate.   Trump’s stop in Beijing is part of a Nov. 3-14 tour of five Asian nations in which North Korea will be a major focus. The visit includes U.S. allies Japan and South Korea who have watched with increasing worry as the United States and North Korea have exchanged bellicose rhetoric.     To prepare for his trip, Trump met with former U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, a key player in President Richard Nixon’s opening to China in 1972.  And over lunch last week at the White House, Trump asked Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong for his opinion about North Korea and its unpredictable leader, a participant said. Lee told him that Kim sees his nuclear weapons program as essential to his survival after the U.S.-led ouster of Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, and Libyan leader Muammar Gaddhafi’s downfall. “Lee said it’s probably impossible for Kim to become convinced that the United States doesn’t want to overthrow him,” a participant at the lunch said. “They’re super-paranoid.”                     While part of the U.S. strategy on North Korea is to deprive Kim Jong Un’s government of resources, Trump has left open the threat of military force. U.S. officials, while emphasizing they want a diplomatic solution, have highlighted military preparedness to counter a North Korean threat and there are three U.S. aircraft carrier groups in the region. Trump has threatened to “totally destroy” North Korea and has derided Kim as a “Rocket Man” on a suicide mission, to the dismay of some U.S. military and intelligence officials who fear such rhetoric could backfire.      As well as pressuring China, the United States is quietly pursuing direct diplomacy with North Korea, using a “New York channel” to get in contact with diplomats at Pyongyang’s United Nations mission.  Analysts in Asia are skeptical Trump’s pressure on China will work. “I don’t think China will seriously change its existing policy on North Korea simply because of more pressure from the United States,” said Zhao Tong, a North Korea expert at the Carnegie-Tsinghua Center in Beijing.     China’s ambassador to the United States, Cui Tiankai, told reporters on Monday it will take a broad effort to pressure North Korea and China alone cannot solve the problem. “China has been doing everything we can on the Korean issue,” he said. In Japan, the threat from Pyongyang hit close to home after tests this year in which two ballistic missiles flew over its territory. But there is concern in Tokyo that the Trump administration lacks a clear North Korea strategy. “The biggest worry is that Trump’s grand Asia policy, North Korea policy, is not well defined... but responds to circumstances instead... ,” said Toshihiro Nayakama, a professor at Keio University. “They turn to China to exert pressure but the question is to what extent there is Chinese pressure. I believe this is not yet evaluated by the U.S. administration,” he said. The Trump administration has considered threatening China with trade actions over its resistance to do more on North Korea. While some advisers from outside his administration have  urged Trump to pursue this course, he has been persuaded against it by his own advisers who have warned of a trade war, U.S. officials said.

       "'Just a few days ago, SportsCenter anchor Jemele Hill made headlines due to her harsh but truthful comments about Donald Trump and his bigot followers.In several tweets posted on Monday, Hill trashed Trump s leadership, calling him unqualified  and  unfit  for the White House. She tweeted: Donald Trump is a white supremacist who has largely surrounded himself w/ other white supremacists. Trump is the most ignorant, offensive president of my lifetime. His rise is a direct result of white supremacy. Period. He is unqualified and unfit to be president. He is not a leader. And if he were not white, he never would have been elected.   Anyone who actually pays attention to Trump, his policies, and his  values  knows that this is 100% true. Unfortunately, ESPN has refused to stand beside her, stating that Hill s views are not shared by the network.On top of that, recent comments by Trump s White House Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders pretty much stated that Trump and his corrupt administration believe that stating the truth about a president should be a considered an offense that could get someone fired.It s clear that Trump and his minions hate being called out, especially when it s true. Proving that his supporters are just as horrible and racist as he is, Trump voters came out in droves to react to Hill s tweets   and actually ended up proving her right. On her Facebook page, Trump supporters couldn t help but leave numerous disgusting, racist comments on the African American anchor s page, which makes what Hill said about Trump even more prevalent.You can see some of the most hideous remarks below:    It is impossible to read through these awful messages and still argue that Trump and his fanbase are not white supremacists.Featured image via D Dipasupil  and Alex Wong / Getty Images'"

       "\"Donald Trump got a late start on his incoherent Twitter whining Sunday but better late than never, we suppose. Once again, our  so-called President  is doing his best to convince the American people that the investigation into his administration s collusion with Russia is fake while simultaneously complaining that Republicans aren t doing enough to protect him from it. As the phony Russian Witch Hunt continues, two groups are laughing at this excuse for a lost election taking hold, Democrats and Russians!  President Snowflake said, adding that  It s very sad that Republicans, even some that were carried over the line on my back, do very little to protect their President.

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 23, 2017The Donald has been doing his best lately to make his Twitter timeline a  safe space,  banning anyone who expresses a dissenting view (a gross violation of their constitutional rights)   but no matter how much he tries, the disdain felt for him by Americans still manages to overcome his efforts to hide from how the country feels about him:Emperor Trump has no clothes.  Eugene Gu, MD (@eugenegu) July 23, 2017It s actually hilarious that Trump is now whining on Twitter about losing the support of his very own party  SAD!  35%  SAD!

Lawrence O Donnell (@Lawrence) July 23, 2017Maybe Republicans are growing a spine and realize that Trump s approval rating will be a liability for them in 2018.

Joann Kline (@JoannKline) July 23, 2017Ah you poor   JC beyond the wall (@JC_in_Calgary) July 23, 2017Trump is really getting nervous lately amid reports that he is desperately seeking ways to pardon not only his family and other co-conspirators but himself   something innocent people do not investigate.It s time for Republicans to stand up to The Donald and impeach him. As Trump said during his campaign,  you either have a country or you don t.  Most Americans would prefer to still have a country when this is all over.Featured image via Getty Images/screengrab\""

       "'Republican Rep. Doug LaMalfa (CA) did not have a good time of things Monday when he broke with tradition and showed up to a town hall meeting to face voters.Attendees at the 400 person event showed a special amount of disdain for the Congressman, who recently voted to take health insurance away from millions of Americans   but one elderly gentleman stands out for saying exactly what each and every voter should be saying to each and every Republican who voted to betray the American people.The man, holding a sign reading  Lackey for the Rich,  stood up to LaMalfa, telling him he deserves the same fate to which he would condemn millions of human beings   to  die in pain.   I think that your vote to throw 22 million people off of health is reprehensible and in the service of the rich,  the man told LaMalfa.  I hope you suffer the same painful fate as those millions that you have voted to remove health care from. May you die in pain. Ouch.Some in attendance took issue with this, but the man shot back,  I m not a nice person. We pray for our constituents, too, sir,  LaMalfa told the gentleman, apparently unaware that thoughts and prayers can t replace a lung or a kidney.Watch video of the town hall below:(function(d, s, id) {  var js, fjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0];  if (d.getElementById(id)) return;  js = d.createElement(s); js.id = id;  js.src = \"//connect.facebook.net/en_US/sdk.js#xfbml=1&version=v2.10\";  fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, fjs);}(document, \\'script\\', \\'facebook-jssdk\\'));The NSPR news team is live right now in Chico at a town hall meeting with Congressman Doug LaMalfa (R-Richvale) and some of his local constituents. We hope to broadcast the event in its entirety if we can maintain a strong internet connection. The full audio of the meeting will be available at mynspr.org later this morning.Posted by North State Public Radio on Monday, August 7, 2017Featured image via screengrab'"

       "'On Saturday night, during a speech to honor veterans in Washington, Donald Trump once again perfectly demonstrated what a petulant child he is and how little he cares about the people who sacrificed their lives for this country.Trump was speaking at the  Celebrate Freedom Rally , where he should have been thanking and praising the veterans in attendance. Instead, he completely derailed and went off on one of his characteristically self-centered rants, proving that he is incapable of acting presidential and focusing on anything but himself for more than a few minutes.While some might hope that Trump chose to stop honoring veterans to make an important announcement, most Americans know that wasn t what happened. Instead, Trump stopped his speech to rant about the  fake media  and bragged about how he d won the election (conveniently leaving out the fact that he lost the popular vote by literally millions).No one understands how Trump went from commending veterans to talking about the media and his presidency, but here s his awful rant: We will not let them because the people know the truth. The fake media tried to stop us from going to the White House but I m president and they re not. The fact is the press has destroyed themselves because they went too far. Instead of being subtle and smart, they used a hatchet. And the people saw it right from the beginning. The dishonest media will never keep us from accomplishing our objectives on behalf our great American people. It will never happen. Their agenda is not your agenda. Considering that Trump had spent his entire Saturday attacking the press, from CNN to MSNBC, he clearly needed to get this out of his system   and it was in extremely poor taste to do it at this event. Trump s insensitivity, immaturity and self-centeredness continues to embarrass the country, and every American who supported Trump should be ashamed. This is not how our veterans should be treated!You can watch Trump come unhinged below:Featured image via Scott Olson / Getty Images'"

       "'WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Senate on Wednesday took a step toward passage of tax legislation that is a top White House priority, setting up a likely decisive vote later this week even though it was unclear if the bill had enough Republican support to become law.Republicans spent the day scrambling to reformulate the  bill, which aims to cut taxes on corporations, other businesses and many individuals and families, to satisfy lawmakers worried about how much it would balloon the U.S. budget deficit. Stocks rallied on optimism it could pass, but obstacles remained, including attempts to address the estimated $1.4 trillion that the bill would add to the United States’ $20 trillion national debt over 10 years. Lawmakers voted 52-48 to begin formal debate, a step that could lead on Thursday and Friday to a full vote on the bill. Republicans are eager to pass the legislation, wanting something to show for their control of the White House and both houses of Congress. Republicans have a 52-48 majority in the 100-member Senate, giving them enough votes to approve the bill if they can hold together. Without Democratic support, Republicans can afford to lose no more than two of their own votes. President Donald Trump in a speech in Missouri on Wednesday, implored members of his own party to get behind the effort, which would be his first significant legislative achievement since taking office in January. “A vote to cut taxes is a vote to put America first again,” Trump said, adding the bill could “cost me a fortune” and that his wealthy friends were not happy. “My accountants are going crazy right now. It’s all right. Hey look, I am president, I don’t care. I don’t care anymore.” Democrats say the tax cuts are a giveaway to corporations and the wealthy at the expense of working Americans. Some Democrats have said Trump and his children would gain from the bill, which would repeal the estate tax on inherited wealth.   Among Americans aware of the Republican tax plan, 49 percent said they were opposed, up from 41 percent in October, according to a Nov. 23-27 Reuters/Ipsos poll released on Wednesday. The latest online poll of 1,257 adults found 29 percent supporting the plan and 22 percent saying they “don’t know.” The sweeping tax package was developed over several months behind closed doors by a small group of senior congressional and Trump administration figures, with little input from many Republican lawmakers and no involvement from Democrats. A major sticking point in the Senate is how the bill deals with the federal deficit and the national debt. Senator Bob Corker, one of the few remaining fiscal hawks in the Republican Party, wants to add a tax snap-back provision to the bill that would raise taxes automatically if economic growth targets are not hit in the future to offset a higher deficit. That trigger proposal has become a target of growing criticism among conservative Republicans and lobbyists, including interest groups aligned with the billionaire industrialists Charles and David Koch, who say the prospect of tax hikes could undermine future economic growth. “I’d prefer not having it there. We’re probably going to have one. But I’d prefer not having it,” Republican Senate Finance Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch told reporters. Republican Senator David Perdue, a businessman from Georgia, said lawmakers could find common ground on a measure that delays any tax hike for at least five years and spreads the prospective burden among those who benefit from Republican tax cuts. Senator Rob Portman, an Ohio Republican on the tax-writing Senate Finance Committee, suggested such an approach may be gaining ground. “It looks like the idea is part way through the first 10 years, there’d be an opportunity to see if the economic growth numbers are performing as expected. And if not, there would be a trigger mechanism over a 10-year period,” Portman said. Democrats and independents were trying to persuade nonpartisan Senate officials to disqualify parts of the bill, including one to allow drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, as impermissible under Senate rules, an aide said. While some Republicans signaled determination to get the bill passed, they still did not have the votes. “It’s time for us to saddle up and ride. And I’m ready to go,” Republican Senator John Kennedy of Louisiana told reporters. Corker declined to say whether he would vote for the tax bill even if Senate Republican leaders agree to the kind of trigger mechanism he wants. “I don’t do conjecture,” he told reporters, saying he could have other concerns about the final legislation. “There are also qualitative issues like the bill not getting any worse, that it doesn’t get more expensive.” '"
